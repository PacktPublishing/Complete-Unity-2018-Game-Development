# Complete Unity 2018 Game Development
Through this Learning Path, you'll learn how to leverage the features of Unity and create amazing games, ranging from action shooters and mind-bending puzzle games to adventure and Virtual Reality(VR) games. If you have no prior experience of using Unity, you can still benefit from this Learning Path, which easily explains the complete working of the Unity toolset. 
You'll start by learning how to create compelling shaders using Unity and understanding everything you need to know about vectors. This includes useful inputs on how lighting is constructed with vectors and how textures are used to create complex effects without the need for advanced math. In the succeeding chapters, you'll also be able to use popular AI techniques, such as `A*` and `A*mbush` to develop intelligent pathfinding agents for your games. The Learning Path will also guide you through different algorithms for creating decision-making agents that go beyond simple behaviors and movement.
By the end of this Learning Path, you will have developed all the basic skills to create highly engaging and replayable games.


## What you will learn
* Understand concepts such as game objects, components, and scenes
* Create functional games with C# scripting
* Write shaders from scratch in ShaderLab and HLSL/Cg
* Develop intelligent pathfinding agents with A* and A*mbush
* Work with terrains and world-creation tools
* Simulate senses for agents to make decisions based on the environment
* Implement waypoints by creating a manual selector
* Enhance games with volumetric explosions, special effects, and visuals



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: SSE2 instruction set support
* **GPU**: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities
* **Memory**: 8GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 30GB or more
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows (8 or higher)
* Unity 2018.1.0f2
